# WP Username Changer

**Let users change their username.**

WP Username Changer is a WordPress plugin that allows users to change their usernames through a shortcode-enabled page. It also includes a system for managing username change requests after the user has reached their limit.

## How It Works

1. **User-Initiated Changes**:
   - Add the provided shortcode `[username_changer]` to a page.
   - Users can visit this page and change their username **up to 2 times**.

2. **Request System**:
   - After reaching the 2-change limit, users can still submit requests for further username changes via the same shortcode-enabled page.
   - These requests are sent to the admin for review.

3. **Admin Management**:
   - Admins can review all submitted username change requests in the WordPress admin panel by navigating to **Users > Username Change Requests**.
   - Requests can be approved or dismissed directly from the admin panel.

## Features

- **Shortcode-Based**: Easily add the functionality to any page using the `[username_changer]` shortcode.
- **Change Limits**: Users can change their usernames up to 2 times.
- **Request Handling**: A seamless request system for additional changes beyond the limit.
- **Admin Control**: Approve or dismiss requests directly from the WordPress admin dashboard.
